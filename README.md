Cold start energy consumption forecasting
Can you predict the electrical demands of buildings that lack historical consumption data?

Goal
Forecast hourly, daily, and weekly energy consumption for new buildings with no prior energy consumption data (“cold start”)

Significance
Forecasts are used to support energy-saving measures that optimize the operation of heating and cooling equipment and energy storage systems

Data
Prior energy consumption of 758 buildings (time series)
Holidays
Temperature (time series)
Building characteristics

Challenges
Data is incomplete
Time resolution varies across buildings
